# Privacy Policy for OpenStaty

**Last updated:** February 09, 2026

OpenStaty ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**OpenStaty is designed to be a privacy-first, offline application.**

-   **We do NOT collect, store, or transmit your personal data, chat history, or contacts to any external servers.**
-   **All processing of your WhatsApp chat exports happens locally on your device.**
-   The analysis and statistics generated by the app are for your viewing only and remain on your device unless you explicitly choose to share the results (e.g., sharing a screenshot or summary).

## 2. Permissions

To function correctly, OpenStaty requires specific permissions:

-   **Storage / File Access**: This permission is necessary to allow you to select and import the WhatsApp chat export files (`.txt` or `.zip`) from your device storage. We only access the specific files you choose to import or share with the app.

## 3. Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services that collect personal information. The app functions entirely without an internet connection for its core features.

## 4. Data Security

Since your data never leaves your device and is processed locally in your phone's memory, your chat history remains as secure as your device itself. We do not have access to your data.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
